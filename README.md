from the analysis we found that:The New Orleans Pelicans have the highest number of employees, totaling 19. The majority of teams have around 15 employees. SG is the most common position, with 102 employees, while the C position has the fewest employees.The predominant age group among employees is 20-30 years, comprising 334 individuals, indicating a young workforce. There are no employees above the age of 50, demonstrating that the company only employs individuals under 50 years old.The Atlanta Hawks team offers the highest salaries. Employees in the Center position receive the highest salaries. A correlation analysis indicates that salary increases with age, suggesting that more experienced employees earn higher wages. However, given the company's preference for younger employees, older employees tend to receive comparatively lower salaries
